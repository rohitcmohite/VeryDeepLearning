1. Assignment 1 - 
    Assignment 1 is regarding Forest Cover type dataset. The dataset includes 7 different forest cover types. Need to predict the forest cover type based on input features provided. It is solved using Fully Connected Neural Network.
2. Assignment 2 - This Assignment contains 2 tasks,
    Task 1: It is a classification task on CIFAR10 dataset. Need to classify dataset with 10 different categories. It is solved using Convolutional Neural Networks.
    Task 2: It is again a classification task from Kaggle, Dog Breed Classification Dataset. For this problem we have been usiing Transfer Learning approach. I tried it using Alexnet, Resnet18, pretrained networks. Further tried to improve accuracy by adding more layers at the end. received a score of 1.4 in kaggle.
